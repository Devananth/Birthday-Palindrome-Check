# Birthday Palindrome Check

### About
This is a fun web application created using Vanilla JS. It gets user's DOB as input and checks whether it is a palindrome in any of its formats like DD-MM-YYYY , DD-YYYY-MM , MM-DD-YYYY ,
MM-YYYY-DD , YYYY-DD-MM , YYYY-MM-DD. If it's not a palindrome then it would display the nearest palindrome date.
